# Contributor Code of Conduct

## The Skinny (TL;DR)

Whoa, a **Code of Conduct**. Don't worry, The Thought Police won't be busting down the 
door. Just don't be a jerk, try to be respectful.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, political affiliation, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion or lack thereof. 

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Publishing others' public information, such as a social media posts or 
  profiles outside of GitHub, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Code

The code we write should reflect both the technical and social standards 
defined in the **CONTRIBUTING.md** document and this **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** document. 
In addition to following the technical standards defined in **PHP Code Sniffer's** 
`phpcs.xml` definition file. 

Always remember that your code needs to be read by other developers. Most concepts 
can be inferred by using well-named variables and using spacing between small blocks 
of several lines of code. Sometimes it is helpful to precede these blocks with a single 
line comment.

Code comments should be short, descriptive and professional. A comment 
should never use derogatory language, expletives, colourful metaphors, insults to 
other developers. It should also never contain nonsense characters or ASCII art. 
All written content should be professional.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this **Code of Conduct**, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This **Code of Conduct** applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team through the GitHub repository. All 
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response 
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project 
team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter 
of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be 
posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the **Code of Conduct** in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
